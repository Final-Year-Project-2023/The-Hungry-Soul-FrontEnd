# CONTRIBUTION RULES:

1. Always prepend your commits with the commit type.

```
Example:
1. feat: A new feature
2. fix: A bug fix
3. docs: Changes to documentation
4. style: Formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
5. refactor: Refactoring production code
6. revert: Reverting things
7. test: Adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
8. chore: Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change
9. perf: A code change that improves performance
10. ci: CI related changes
```
2. Do not start your commit with capital letters; use small letters.
   example: Use ```feat: add signup routes``` instead of ```feat: Add Sign Up Routes```
3. Commits should be in Present tenses.
4. Do not directly commit into the develop branch even in your private repos, use feature branches.
